I'm flyin'
I'm flyin' high like a bird
But my fluttering wings can't keep you from pullin' me down
Your mama
Your mama says I'm a fool
And yeah, maybe that's true 'cause I can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
I'm tryin'
I'm tryin' not to forget my words
'Cause when I'm around you, I tend not to changin' my mind
I promised
I promised myself not to slip back into old habit
'Cause heartbreak is savvy and love is a bitch
